"""Optional Google emulator detection for the ``local`` profile (opt-in, never required).

For the stores that have an official Google emulator, the local adapters can route to it
for higher-fidelity local development WHEN the standard emulator env var is set AND the
matching client library (from the ``[gcp]`` extra) imports. Otherwise the adapters use
their SDK-free SQLite / in-process path, which is the default.

This module only *detects* the opt-in; it deliberately performs **no google-cloud import
at module top level**. Each adapter that supports an emulator imports the google client
lazily, inside the method, and only on the emulator branch, so the default local path and
the offline test suite never import a google-cloud package.

There is no emulator for the Gen AI evaluation service, Gemini, BigQuery query semantics
or Cloud Storage object-card layout used here in a way that benefits A4's offline path, so
those adapters stay on the SDK-free workaround unconditionally. The Firestore emulator is
wired for the in-process registry as the representative opt-in.
