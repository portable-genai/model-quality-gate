"""IdentityPort : resolve a verified Principal from inbound transport context.

The Protocol is NOT declared here. It comes from :mod:`hex_service_kit.identity`, beside the
:class:`~hex_service_kit.identity.Principal` and
:class:`~hex_service_kit.identity.RequestContext` it maps between, so there is exactly one
definition for the whole catalog to change and no copy of it can drift.

The contract is unchanged: the API layer hands the adapter a ``RequestContext`` (the request
headers) and gets back a verified ``Principal``, or an ``IdentityError``. The active profile picks
the adapter: ``local`` resolves a seeded dev persona (no IdP/AD/LDAP) so demos and tests run
offline, ``gcp`` / ``platform`` verify the Identity-Aware-Proxy-injected signed assertion, and
``onprem`` is the placeholder for the client's own enterprise IdP (OIDC/SAML). This keeps the
per-user identity decision swappable by configuration like every other port (P-02), and is the
single seam where the client-asserted actor/ACL is replaced by a server-verified one.

This module ALSO carries what an identity adapter DECLARES about the end-user authentication
it can provide, because the exposure guard on the app object has one question to answer before
it can decide anything: are this service's END-USER routes authenticated? Nothing else in the
configuration answers it, and two things that look like they do, do not:

* The PROFILE names an adapter family, not an authentication scheme. A deliberate ``local`` and
  an inherited one bind the same seeded personas, and a client's own IdP adapter can be bound
  under ``onprem`` without the profile string changing at all.
* The SERVICE-TO-SERVICE secret authenticates a calling SERVICE. It authenticates no end user,
  so its presence is not evidence that ``/v1/personas`` or ``/v1/datasets`` is protected.

The adapter bound to the identity port is the only thing that knows, so it says so here, and
the guard reads the answer from the binding rather than inferring it from something else.

Three answers, and the difference between the first two is the whole point:

* :data:`VERIFIED` - the adapter resolves a principal from something it VERIFIES server side (a
  signed assertion whose signature, issuer, expiry and audience it checks). A caller cannot name
  itself, so end-user routes ARE authenticated.
* :data:`CLIENT_ASSERTED` - the adapter resolves a principal from something the CLIENT wrote
  (the seeded ``X-Dev-Persona`` picker, which also has a DEFAULT persona, so a caller that sends
  no header at all is still somebody). A caller chooses who it is, so end-user routes are NOT
  authenticated, however many other credentials the deployment has configured.
* :data:`UNIMPLEMENTED` - the adapter resolves nobody at all: a portability placeholder waiting
  for the client's own IdP. Nobody can be authenticated, so nothing is.

An adapter that declares NOTHING is read as :data:`CLIENT_ASSERTED`, never :data:`VERIFIED`.
Silence is not a claim to verify anything, and a guard that reads silence as "authenticated"
switches itself off for every adapter somebody forgot to annotate, which is the fail-open shape
these declarations exist to remove.
