# logging_worm.tf : WORM audit trail: locked Cloud Logging bucket + sink + audit config.
#
# General Principle map:
#   P-08 (immutable audit / WORM): the audit log is routed to a Cloud Logging bucket
#         whose retention is var.retention_days (~7 years) and whose `locked = true`
#         makes it Write-Once-Read-Many. The audit adapter (cloud_logging_audit)
#         writes every gate / eval / red-team AuditEvent here.
#   P-03 (residency): bucket location is us-central1.
#   P-09 (CMEK explicit): the bucket is CMEK-encrypted (logging SA key binding in kms.tf).

# # Setting `locked = true` below permanently prevents reducing retention or  # #
# # deleting this bucket for the full retention window. You CANNOT undo it,   # #
