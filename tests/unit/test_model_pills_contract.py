"""The half of the model-pills contract that lives in the BROWSER.

Every served console shows two small pills at the top right of every page: the model that
ANSWERED the last request, and ``Search`` when that answer used an online search tool (owner
decision, 2026-09-23). They replaced a full-width provenance banner that named the model
configuration would call rather than the one that answered. The SERVICE half (the runtime and
``generator_model`` on ``/healthz``, the two answer headers and their CORS exposure) is pinned
in ``tests/unit/test_health_provenance.py`` and ``tests/unit/test_answer_provenance.py`` and is
not restated here.

This file pins the other half, because the other half is the one that has broken before. On
2026-09-04 eight consoles were found to have rendered NOTHING on every page load since the
banner landed: the component named ``/api/agent``, the same-origin route handler the service
template ships, in trees that ship no such handler. The health call reached a path nothing
serves, took the failure branch, and the failure branch renders nothing, deliberately. A check
that cannot fail loudly fails as an ABSENCE, and an absence is exactly what no reviewer notices.

This console calls its service DIRECTLY at ``API_BASE`` (resolved once in ``ui/lib/api``), with
no Next route handler in between, so there is no proxy to forward the headers: the pills must
read that same base, and the service's responses must expose both headers to a cross-origin
reader. ``ui/tests/answer-provenance.test.mjs`` proves the one fetch wrapper itself.
