"""The exposure guard rides the APP OBJECT, and is derived from the IDENTITY BINDING.

The defect this file is the standing guard for: the only bound on serving the no-auth `local`
posture to the network lived in `resolve_bind_host(...)`, inside `main()`. The shipped entry
point never reaches `main()` -- the Dockerfile CMD is

    exec uvicorn model_quality_gate.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT}

so the bound was a property of one entry point rather than of the application. Executed against
this repo with `AI_QUALITY_PROFILE=local`, a peer at 203.0.113.7 carrying no credential read the
whole seeded-persona roster off `GET /v1/personas` and the golden-dataset list off
`GET /v1/datasets`.

The fix puts the guard on the `app` object, registered LAST so it is the OUTERMOST middleware:
an off-loopback caller is refused before CORS, before the header baseline and before any route
or dependency runs. This file asserts BOTH directions, because a guard that refuses everybody is
not a fix:

* a LAN peer is refused with 503 on every route, including the ones that carry no credential
  by design (`/healthz`);
* a loopback peer is still served 200, so the offline demo and the whole local workflow work.

The posture itself is derived from the identity BINDING, never from a credential. Whether
`AI_QUALITY_S2S_TOKEN` happens to be set is evidence about a calling SERVICE and says nothing
about the end-user routes, so a scanner here fails the build if the guard's argument reaches a
credential at any depth.
